                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                    Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
            </article>
